# Althistsite-2 (Rise of the German Hegemony)
This is an alternate history website disguised as a history website.

The premise of the website is that it covers an alternative world war 2 and world war 3 in a world where the Central Powers had won World War One

## What this is based off of? 

The idea for this website was gotten from a mod called Kaiserreich in the game Hearts of Iron 4. The setting of the mod takes place in a world where the central powers won world war one, using HOI4 as a medium to explore this world's politics as you prepare your country to fight in the coming second world war. 

Specifically this came from one of my Kaiserreich campaigns where I was playing as the German Empire (right around when Germany got their new focus tree when the mod got out of beta). I had so much fun with that campaign that I decided to document it and turn it into a website as a memento.

I took this oppertunity to learn React and Web Development but also took the time to turn the data I got from my campaign into an overarching story.

# What is covered inside this website

The website has 2 main pages of content
1. The articles detailing the timeline of events during this world's second and third world war.
